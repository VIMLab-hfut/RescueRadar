This CPR dataset is used to identify correct CPR postures before training, to guide users to make roughly correct CPR postures, which can also be used by users who are completely unfamiliar with CPR. This model is designed for the universality, fluency, and completeness of the experimental process, and will not affect the experimental results.
We took CPR photos and videos ourselves and used Mediapipe to extract the original dataset of bone keypoint coordinates, and labeled the up or down posture of CPR.
The second column is used to distinguish whether it is a CPR posture, while the following 99 columns represent the x, y, and z three-dimensional coordinates of 33 key points in the human body.
