This CPR dataset is used to identify correct CPR postures before training, to guide users to make roughly correct CPR postures, which can also be used by users who are completely unfamiliar with CPR. This model is designed for the universality, fluency, and completeness of the experimental process, and will not affect the experimental results.
We took CPR photos ourselves and used Mediapipe to extract the original dataset of bone keypoint coordinates, and labeled the up or down posture of CPR.
Each row of the original dataset represents the extracted data from an image. The first 99 columns represent the x, y, and z three-dimensional coordinates of 33 key points in the human body, while the 100th column corresponds to the down or up posture of CPR using 0 and 1.
When using, it is recommended to preprocess according to the purpose. If the purpose is to recognize the up or down posture of CPR, the distinction in column 100 can be used for binary classification; The purpose of this project is to identify whether it is a CPR posture, therefore both types of movements are classified as CPR postures and do not require data from column 100. And remember to normalize the coordinate data.
