The experimental data comes from two parts: the scoring report of the RescueRadar system and the user's performance and scoring in the survey questionnaire. 
All questions of the survey questionnaire have been listed in the Raw Data table of the RescueRadar Data.xlsx file, and the collected data has undergone preliminary processing. The multiple-choice section distinguishes whether the answer is correct or incorrect by using 0 and 1, while the scoring section collects scoring results using a Likert vector table ranging from 1 to 7 points.  
Part of the processed core data was also placed in the Core Data table of the RescueRadar Data.xlsx file, and we conducted a series of detailed statistical analyses, including t-distribution, confidence interval estimation and Wilcoxon signed rank tests etc. based on this data. The details can be found in Section 5.4 of the article.
